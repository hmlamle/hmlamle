- 👋 Hi, I’m @hmlamle, AKA Hannah-Marie

- 🌱 I’m currently learning A LOT! Foundational ecological theory and coral reef ecology to aid in my PhD studies, and R for statistical analysis. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing outside of my labs projects, I've got enough on my plate right now. 
- 📫 How to reach me: email is best -> hlamle@fiu.edu
